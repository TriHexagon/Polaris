# The Polaris ARM Cortex-M4 Microcontroller Operating System Project

Polaris is an experimental operating system for ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller devices
licensed under MIT-Licence. It is completely written from scratch in C and uses CMSIS.

**WARNING**: Polaris is under heavy development, some parts may be unstable!

## What it already does
- boots from ROM and RAM (RAM mode needs an external bootloader)
- initializes MPU, NVIC and FPU unit (if available)
- installs exception handlers for fault handling
- creates heap in order to provide dynamic memory allocation for kernel and driver modules
- provides device driver interface

## What is to do
- virtual file system
- file system driver interface
- esromfs driver
- process module with ELF support
- syscall module
- sd card driver
- FAT driver
- API
- system initializer service (like the linux init process)
- guides and more documentation
- shell
- standard tools

## Far future plans
- multithreading support
- Cortex-M7 support
